├── assets/  
│   ├── images/       # All SVG and image assets  
│   ├── css/  
│       └── style.css # Stylesheet for the webpage  
│   └── js/  
│       └── script.js # JavaScript animations and interactions

🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/animated-christmas-website.git
cd animated-christmas-website

2️⃣ Open Locally

Run the project locally by opening index.html in your browser:
open index.html

3️⃣ Live Server (Optional)

    Install Live Server in VSCode.
    Right-click index.html and select "Open with Live Server."
🛠️ Customization

Make this project your own!
🎨 Edit Colors and Fonts

Modify the colors or typography in the style.css file:
:root {
  --first-color: hsl(1, 100%, 38%); /* Change primary color here */
  --body-font: "Montserrat", sans-serif; /* Change fonts here */
}

🖼️ Update Images

Replace images in the assets/images/ directory to fit your theme. Use tools like Canva for custom designs.
🌟 Add More Animations

Enhance animations in script.js with GSAP:
gsap.from(".your-element", { duration: 2, x: -100, opacity: 0 });

🔧 Troubleshooting
❓ Snow Animation Not Working

Ensure your internet connection allows fetching external scripts from Embedim.
❓ Fonts Not Loading

Double-check your @import URL in style.css. Make sure Google Fonts isn't blocked.
❓ Mobile Responsiveness Issues

Use browser developer tools to inspect and adjust the CSS for smaller screen sizes.

Here’s an updated and more detailed version of the README.md file. I’ve added sections on installation, customization, acknowledgments, and troubleshooting, along with a more comprehensive feature list and call-to-action elements.
